Each subdirectory contains a dataset that has been analyzed by students in the
Dietrich College Research Training Program at CMU. (Our contribution to the
DC RTP is given the course number 36-198.) You may feel free to use these
datasets. (They are--or should be--curated datasets, i.e., no data wrangling
should be needed prior to EDA, etc.)
