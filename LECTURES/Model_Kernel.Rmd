Kernel
===

A kernel $K(x)$ is a weighting function used in estimators. Full stop. A kernel technically has only one required property:

- $K(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$.

However, in the manner that kernels are used in statistics, there are two other properties that are usually satisfied:

- $\int_{-\infty}^\infty K(x) dx = 1$; and 
- $K(-x) = K(x)$ for all $x$.

In short: a kernel is a symmetric pdf!

Commonly Used Kernels

A general rule of thumb: the choice of kernel will have little effect on estimation, particularly if the sample size is large! The Gaussian kernel (i.e., a normal pdf) is by far the most common choice, and is the default for `R` functions that utilize kernels.

Kernel Density Estimation
===

The setting: we have $n$ data sampled from some unknown distribution $P$ with pdf $f(x)$
$$
X_1,\ldots,X_n \sim P
$$
Density estimation is a nonparametric technique for attempting to estimate $f(x)$ with as few assumptions about its form as possible. Note that there is no response variable here: we are simply trying to estimate the underlying pdf from which data are sampled.

In kernel density estimation (or KDE) in particular, the estimator is
$$
\hat{f}_h(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{h}K\left(\frac{x-X_i}{h}\right)
$$

The key? To estimate the optimal value of $h$!

KDE: Estimating the Bandwidth h
===

The workhorse function for univariate KDE in `R` is `density()`:

`x` is your vector of data, and the `kernel` is `"gaussian"` by default. The key argument here is `bw`, standing for "bandwidth". There are two general approaches for estimating the optimal bandwidth.

The "plug-in" approach utilizes empirical formulae. Above, `nrd0` represents the plug-in formula of Silverman (1986):
$$
h_{\rm opt} = 0.9\mbox{min}\left(s,\frac{IQR}{1.34}\right)n^{-1/5}
$$
where $s$ is the sample standard deviation and $IQR$ is the inter-quartile range. A variant, `nrd`, utilizes Scott's rule and simply changes 0.9 to 1.06.

KDE: Estimating the Bandwidth h
===

The other general approach is to minimize a loss function. (The MSE in regression is an estimation of the average value of a loss function...so you've seen loss functions before.) A typical loss function to use is the *integrated mean-squared error*:
$$
L = \int (\hat{f}_h(x) - f(x))^2 dx \propto \int \hat{f}_h^2(x) dx - 2 \int \hat{f}_h(x) f(x) dx \,.
$$
This is coded as the "unbiased CV estimator"
$$
\hat{J}(h) = \left( \int \hat{f}_h^2(x) dx \right) - \frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{f}_{h,-i}(X_i) \,,
$$
where in the second term, $\hat{f}_{h,-i}(X_i)$ is the predicted value of $\hat{f}_h(X_i)$ when $X_i$ is left out of the estimation process. (So this is "leave-one-out cross-validation.")

When you use `density()`, you would apply the argument `bw="ucv"`.

Note that the output from `density()` will list the optimum value of $h$ but will not show values of $\hat{J}(h)$ for all values of $h$ tried. If you need to plot $\hat{J}(h)$ vs. $h$, you might use, e.g., the `kedd` package. But this is generally not necessary.

KDE in Two or More Dimensions
===

The base `stats` package function `density()` only works with univariate data.

In two dimensions, an oft-used density estimator is `kde2d()` from the `MASS` package. Note that (a) while it allows $h_x$ and $h_y$ to be different, it doesn't allow for correlations between them, and (b) there is no option for searching for optimal values. So: you pick $\mathbf{h}$ but it might not be optimal.

For multivariate cases, you may need to strike out into newer territory, like the `ks` package. Regardless of which package you choose, keep in mind that due to the curse of dimensionality, (actually useful) KDE generally becomes impossible beyond $p \approx 5$.

Kernel Regression
===

As a final note, realize that one can apply kernels in the regression setting as well as in the density estimation setting.

The classic kernel regression estimator is the Nadaraya-Watson estimator:
$$
\hat{y}_h(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n l_i(x) Y_i \,,
$$
where
$$
l_i(x) = \frac{K\left(\frac{x-X_i}{h}\right)}{\sum_{j=1}^n K\left(\frac{x-X_j}{h}\right)} \,.
$$
Basically, the regression estimate is the average of all the *weighted* observed response values; the farther $x$ is from a datum, the less weight that datum has in determining the regression estimate at $x$.

The workhorse function for kernel regression in `R` is `ksmooth()` from the base `stats` package. Tuning to find the optimal value of $h$ is not necessarily simple; it is $O(n^{-1/5})$ and thus you can use $n^{-1/5}$ as an initial estimate.
