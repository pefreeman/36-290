Why Version Control?
===

"The person who knows the most about your code is you-six-months-ago, and you-six-months-ago are not replying to your emailed questions." -Anon.

The features of version control:

- It allows you to keep a complete record of changes, allowing you to, e.g., revert back to a previous version of your code if things have gone awry.

- As part of that complete record, it allows you to store messages for every change, so that you can recall the rationale for a change later.

- With, e.g., `Git`, you can back your code up in the cloud (e.g., on `GitHub`), allowing for easy distribution.

Note that here I am talking about "code," but version control can also be useful when you are, for instance, writing reports (like your DAs in 36-401).

Git Basics
===

`Git` allows you to take "snapshots" of the contents of a folder on your machine as you make changes to them. (This is your local repository, or "repo".) Fix a bug? Take a snapshot. Add functionality? Take a snapshot. These snapshots are dubbed *commits*. Snapshot details are stored in the subfolder .git.

Every time you commit your changes, you write a message that clearly indicates the changes that you have made since your last commit.

In `Git`, two or more people can make independent changes to the same code, or one person can have two or more different code versions being developed in parallel, via *branching*. (Technically a branch is a pointer to a particular commit...think of it as you point to a particular version of a code and "branch out" from there. The default branch is the *master*.) Development spawned by branching can later be *merged*.

Install GitHub
===

1) If you do not have a `GitHub` account, get one at `github.com`!

Install Git
===

2) If you do not have `Git` installed on your laptop, install it!

- Mac: `Git for Mac` (at `https://git-scm.com/downloads`) or via `homebrew` (`brew install git`)

- Linux: `apt-get install git` or `yum install git`

- Windows: `Git for Windows` (at `https://git-scm.com/downloads`)

During setup, configure `Git` with your user name (**use your full name, not your Andrew ID**) and your user email (**which should be the same one you used to sign up for your `GitHub` account**).

Linking RStudio to an Existing GitHub Repo
===

In `RStudio`, do the following:

- click on `File > New Project...`

- click on "Version Control", then on "Git"

- provide the *full* address for the "Repository URL" (including the `https`, etc.; by default, this will provide the name of your local repository)

- make sure "Create project as subdirectory of:" points to where you want to point it (I'd suggest that you have a `GIT` folder, with your project(s) being subdirectories of that folder)

- click on "Create Project"

At this point, you should find that your `Files` pane is listing the files in your local repository, including one ending in `.Rproj` and and `Rmd` file that contains your lab.

Updating Your Repository
===

To, e.g., update the `Rmd` file on your local repository (and to add the `html` file), do the following:

- edit the `Rmd` file so as to add your answers to lab questions

- save the file...at this point, the file name should show up in the `Git` pane next to an "M" symbol (for modified)

- knit the file...at this point, an `html` file should also appear in the `Git` pane next to an "M" symbol

- continue to modify the files, or...stage the files for a commit (think of it as: pose it for its snapshot) by clicking on "Staged" in the Git pane

- click on "Commit" in the `Git` pane

- in the new window that opens, add a "Commit message", then click on the "Commit" button

- click on "Push" to push your changes from your local repo to your `GitHub` repo

Done.
