For Fall 2021, first see below, then note that I am in the process of
not only updating the notes, but also converting them to xaringan format
(i.e., making the slides a bit prettier). The `HTML` versions of notes will be
made available here, week by week, while the `R Markdown`-based source files
will be made available in the `R_Markdown` folder.

Feel free to peruse (and use) these. 

---

This directory contains 36-290 lectures in individual `R Markdown` files 
for Fall 2020. Note that material may be added in Weeks 11 and 12 (e.g.,
generalized additive models, or neural nets if I'm feeling inspired, etc.).

The name of each file contains the number of the week in which the file
is to be accessed for class (e.g., 07 for seventh week), either "T" or
"R" for Tuesday or Thursday, an optional letter giving the order if multiple
files are to be accessed in one class session, and a very short, if not
completely inscrutable, indication of the file topic.

Feel free to download, edit, and use in your own course.

For accompanying labs, and/or for additional notes sets that give examples 
(where they exist...these would be sets that are used in contexts outside of 
36-290), contact me at `pfreeman AT cmu DOT edu`. 
Such sets include ones for, e.g., 
linear and logistic regression, best subset selection and penalized regression,
trees, random forest, boosting, SVM, and Naive Bayes.
