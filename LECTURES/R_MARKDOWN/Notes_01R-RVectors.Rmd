## Motivation

A *vector* in `R` is a homogeneous collection of numbers, strings, or `TRUE`/`FALSE` values (i.e., logicals). 

A collection of (column) vectors, all of the same length, can be bound together into a data table (called a *data frame*) that might provide the input to, e.g., a regression analysis. So in our discussion of statistical learning, it makes sense to start with a discussion of `R` vectors and how you might use (and manipulate!) them.

## Vectors in R

.center[![:scale 30%](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~pfreeman/vectors.png)]

Atomic vectors are <i>homogeneous</i>, i.e., all elements of the vectors are of the same type.
The types of atomic vectors (or just vectors) are:

- `double`: double-precision floating-point numbers (8 bytes per element);

- `integer`: integer numbers (4 bytes per element);

- `logical`: `TRUE` and `FALSE`;

- `character`: individual strings (at 1 byte per character within each string);

- and `complex` and `raw` (not covered here).

Note: the `integer` and `double` types are collectively (and at times confusingly)
dubbed `numeric`. (Confusingly because one can cast to a numeric type, which is equivalent to
casting to double.)

## Initializing Vectors

Let's show the various ways in which one can initialize a vector
(in this case, of integers) of length five:

<table>
<tr><td><tt>x = c(0,0,0,0,0)</tt></td><td>c = "collection" or "container"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = rep(0,5)</tt></td><td>rep = "repeat"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = vector("integer",5)</tt></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = integer(5)</tt></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = seq(1,5,by=1)</tt></td><td>seq = "sequence"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>x = 1:5</tt></td><td>steps by 1</td></tr>
</table>

Note that one can use all six of these functions to initialize `numeric` vectors, and the first four to initialize those of mode `logical` or `character`:
```{r}
vector("logical",5)
character(5)
```

---

## Initializing Vectors

A few more points to make here:

- You can combine initialization functions, which can be helpful:
```{r}
x = c(rep(0,5),11:14,numeric(3))
x
```

- You can concatenate vectors too:
```{r}
x = 1:3
y = 78:83
(z = append(x,y))
```
(Why the parentheses? It's an `R` trick: you can assign to a new variable *and* print its contents in one line of code.)

- Note my use of the equals sign, `=`. Purists (of which I am not one) utilize the assignment operator `<-` instead. You may use either.

## Handy Vector Functions

To determine the type of a vector:
```{r}
x = c(1,0,3,2)
typeof(x)
```

To determine the number of elements in a vector:
```{r}
length(x)
```

To display the $n^{th}$ element of a vector, where $n \in [1,length(x)]$:
```{r}
x[1]
```

To explicitly cast from one type to another:
```{r}
as.character(x)
```

---

## Handy Vector Functions

To sort a vector in ascending order, and to retrieve the sorted vector indices:
```{r}
x
sort(x)
order(x)
```

To display the unique values of a vector:
```{r}
unique(x)
table(x)
```

---

## Logical Subsetting

.center[![:scale 50%](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~pfreeman/relational.png)]

If you apply a relational operator to a vector, the output will be a logical vector:
```{r}
set.seed(101)
x = rnorm(10)
x>0
```

---

## Logical Subsetting

<b>&iexcl;MUY IMPORTANTE&excl;</b> If you apply a logical vector of length $n$ to a vector of
length $n$, then <i>only the elements of the second vector associated with the value TRUE will
be displayed!</i> For instance:
```{r}
x
x[x>0]
```

---

## Logical Subsetting

The output from relational operators can be combined using the logical and operator (&amp;) or the
logical or operator (|):
```{r}
y = x>0 & x<0.5
x[y]
y = x<0 | x>0.5
x[y]
```

---

## Logical Subsetting: sum()

To determine how many values in your vector satisfy a condition, combine one or more relational
operators with the `sum()` function:
```{r}
sum(x>-0.5&x<0)
```

---

## Logical Subsetting: which()

To determine which elements of the original vector satisfy a condition, combine one or more
relational operators with the `which()` function:
```{r}
which(x>-0.5&x<0)
```

Another means by which to subset a vector is to apply the output of the `which()` function. 
Note how adding a minus sign changes the output!
```{r}
w = which(x<0)
x[w]
x[-w]
```

---

## Missing Data: NA

`NA` means "Not Available" and is the preferred way in `R` to denote missing data.

To determine whether vector elements are `NA`, we can use the `is.na()` function, which returns a logical vector.
```{r}
x = c(1,NA,3)
is.na(x)
```
